___

A mere devotion,   
started out as a rather humble promise
has ripened.
couple heart woven,
a bond intent than blood,
adherents of the heart,
their amity, a never lost love.
an odyssey of compassion,
with each stage, guiding me towards tomorrow
an eternal voyage,
to cease like those of phoenix' ashen.

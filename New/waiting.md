i feel lost,   
waiting to be found.   
lost deeply in an unknown world.   
a land afar from all the smiles,   
a land of no joy, away from which all the love flies.  

i feel lost,  
lost in a region of the broken,  
a world of no compassion,  
and the hurt it gives is unspoken.  

i was waiting,  
waiting to be found,  
from what I saw in that world,  
were only my fears kept inbound.

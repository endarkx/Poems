I'm a deceiver, i'm a liar...
If you do believe me I'm a liar.
If you don't well I'm a liar.
Whatever the world says.
Whatever they believe I'm...
I'll say this.
I'm a deceiver, I'm a liar.
I lie to the world and to myself.
I'm a deceiver, I'm a liar.
I'm lying to the world and to my soul.
I'm lying about my life and about all.
I'm lying about me to the world.
When they ask, I'll say
I'm a deceiver, I'm a liar....

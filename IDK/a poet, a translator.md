Sometimes I wonder if I am the weaver of words,  
Crafting each verse with care and skill, like a arras of birds.
Or perhaps I'm a translator of the universe's song,  
Piecing together syllables like stars to where they belong.
Amongst the cosmic whispers and the universe's murmurings,
As a translator of its essence, I find my soul's yearnings.

`Â©Kendra Pokhrel`
